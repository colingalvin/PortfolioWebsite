                <h3>Crafting elegant music and code</h3>
                <p>
                    For the past 9 years, I have been making a living as a professional musician and music educator in the St. Louis metro area.
                    After finishing a degree in Music Education and Trumpet Performance from Southern Illinios University at Edwardsville,
                    I began my teaching career with a large music program in crisis - budget cuts had forced the junior high district administration
                    to cut all sports and arts funding for the year. For a music program with a national reputation, this was a huge blow. As part a team of three
                    newly-certified music educators, we stepped in to provide the schools with an interim music progam until funding was restored the following year.
                    During this time, I began what was to be a long and fulfilling relationship with the high school music program in the same town,
                    which had just stepped onto the national stage with their first semi-finalist placement in the largest marching band competition in the United States.

                <p>
                    After completing my master's education at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I returned to the St. Louis area to take charge of my own
                    music program, where I taught band and choir for two years while continuing to work with the marching band. In November of 2018, the marching band program
                    achieved their first ever placement within the coveted the top 12 marching bands in America. Throughout all of this time, I remained an active performer,
                    completing contracts Celebrity, Royal Caribbean, Cunard, and P&O Cruise Lines in the ship orchestras. I performed regularly groups ranging from
                    symphony orchestras to salsa and mariachi bands. I also continue to fulfill my obligation to my country, where I serve as a member of the Illinois Air National Guard.
                    At the end of my time teaching, I had the privilege and thrill of directly engaging with nearly 600 young musical minds every single day.

                <p>
                    As I continued down this path, I knew that a change was on the horizon for me. Then, with the devastating blow of COVID-19, I knew I had no choice but to adapt
                    and continue to positively influence the world in a new way. As I had in so many times of struggle during my musical and professional life,
                    I rallied myself to take on this new challenge. After 3 months of relentless work, I can confidently say that I am starting to realize how much
                    I have yet to learn! But, as I continue to do with all of my students, I am confident in my ability to break down problems, find novel and elegant solutions,
                    and continue forward no matter what the challenge.
