                <p>
                  For the past 9 years, I have made a living as a professional musician and music educator in the St. Louis metro area. 
                  As a performer, I have enjoyed numerous opportunities to work with world-class musicians ranging from Chicago Symphony 
                  Orchestra composer-in-residence Augusta Read Thomas to the Barenaked Ladies. As a teacher, I have had the privilege of 
                  teaching for nationally-recognized music programs. At the height of my teaching career, I was thrilled to help shape 
                  and lead 600 young musicians every day of the week (and often on the weekends!)
                </p>
                <p>
                  After 22 years of practice and 7 years of higher education, I knew that a change was in store for me. Then, with the 
                  devastating blow of COVID-19, I knew I had no choice but to adapt and continue to positively influence the world in a new way. 
                  As I had in so many times of struggle during my musical and professional life, I rallied myself to take on this new challenge. 
                  3 months of relentless work later, I can confidently say that I am starting to realize just how much I have yet to learn! 
                  As my students will kindly remind me, however, I've never accepted an excuse to show anything oter than their (or my) best. 
                  As I have refocused my ability to simply, problem solve, and implement novel solutions toward software development, 
                  I am excited to establish myself in this workspace and find my next adventure!
